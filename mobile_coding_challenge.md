Coding Challenge Guidelines
===========================

Please organize, design, and submit your code as if it were going into production,
then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...).

We should be able to run the app in a simulator.

Functional spec

Prototype the following projects:

### Noteworth Lunch Requirements

1. Use the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro).

4. A user should be taken to a details page of the restaurant based on the restaurant
they select.
5. There should be a seperation between the data and view layer.
6. The app should be extensible. 

An adequate solution might be developed within 4 - 8 hours, but please spend however much time it takes to construct a great solution.

High Level UI UX Requirements
-----------------------------

You can use the Yelp app to get inspiration on how to present the List, 
Sorting, and Details page. Feel free to add your own flavor to the app, but use 
these screenshots to get started. Please note that the screenshots presented here 
are just for inspiration, they are not requirements.
