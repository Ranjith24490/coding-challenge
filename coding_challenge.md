Coding Challenge Guidelines
===========================

Please organize, design, and submit your code as if it were going into production,
then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...).

We should be able to run the app in a simulator.

High Level UI/UX Fullstack Inspiration
-----------------------------
You can use the ![Yelp website](https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=restaurants&find_loc=285+Fulton+St%2C+New+York%2C+NY+10006) to get inspiration on how to present the List, 
Sorting, and Details page. Feel free to add your own flavor to the app, but use 
these screenshots to get started. Please note that the screenshots presented here 
are just for inspiration, they are not requirements.
